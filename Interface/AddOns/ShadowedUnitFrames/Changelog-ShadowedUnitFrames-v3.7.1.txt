Tagging as release 3.7.1


--------------------

Shadowed:
	- Fixed LFD Role indicators not working
	- Missing code that wasn't removed
	- Fix the whisper only indicator for party members
	- Removed redundant hiding code
	- Add a separate has aggro color option
	- Apparnetly Blizzard hasn't fixed up their UNIT_FREQUENT_HEALTH events
	- Fixed an error on hiding buff frames
	- Fix Paladin curable spells
	- Move back to checking dispel types ourselves since Blizzard didn't fix their bug still. Also now handles Symbiosis for Paladins giving Druids Cleanse.
	- Should reposition the incheal bars based off of UNIT_HEALTH_FREQUENT rather than UNIT_HEALTH
	- Rewrite the positioning code for complex inc heal bars where the health bar has an alpha attached. Will work correctly in all cases now.
	- Inc heal is now enabled by default
	- Visual fix for config
	- Code cleanup
	- Clean up the Blizzard frame hiding code and make sure to hide Focus ToT and Target ToT
	- Rehide Blizzard frames if they are shown while disabled without tainting them. Accounts for poorly done addons that forcibly show frames like VuhDo and HealBot
