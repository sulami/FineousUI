Tagging as release 3.7.2


--------------------

Shadowed:
	- Fixed Quest boss indicators not showing up
	- Do a one time check on config and check or set height if it's not on relevant areas
	- is501 should be named is510 actually
	- Check UnitCanAssist for friendly spells rather than UnitIsFriend. Should fix range checker bugs
	- Try something slightly more reliable for determining if the initial anchor changed
	- If an unit has <=0 health, will hide the inc heal frame to make sure they don't get stuck when the unit is dead
	- Added missing Remove Curse spell for Mages and Cleanse Spirit for Shamans
	- Fixed an aura offset bug when using top auras with self scaling
	- Not sure why SUF bumps the strata on CRF when we're not hiding it, but I assume I can blame nev for this
	- Should be HookScript not Setscript
	- Drycode fixes for SUF and 5.1, only Monk changes
