FineousUI - Minimal Warlock Raid UI

IMPORTANT: TO DOWNLOAD FROM GITHUB YOU NEED TOO CLICK ON DOWNLOADS ON THE UPPER RIGHT SIDE!
(This might be hard to figure out if you don't know GitHub.)

THX for giving my UI a try. Feedback is welcome.

Instructions:
Step 1: Backup your "Interface" and "WTF" folders.
Step 2: Copy "Interface" and "WTF" to your WoW-Directory.
Step 3: Rename the Subfolders "ACCOUNTNAME", "SERVERNAME" and "CHARACTERNAME" to your
	considered values. (Have a look at your backup if you're not sure what your
	accountname is.)
	There is standard support for Warlocks (obviously) but it may work for most
	other classes, too.
Step 4: Login and type "/reflux switch FineousUI".
Step 6:	Maybe you have to configure some Addons on your own.
	To help you, here is a short list of chat-commands:
	Unitframes: /suf
	Actionbars: /dom
	Castbars: /acb
	Tooltips: /tiptac
	Nameplates: /pp
	Damage-/Healmeter: /skada config (Disabled in my config)
	Bossmod: /bigwigs
	Special Power Bar: /cppba
	Combattext: /msbt
	Timer Bars: /ntk (Important if you do not play (Affliction-) Warlock!)
	Just look out for Profile-Options, choose Fineous-Stormscale and press copy.
Step 7: Profit!

Some useful information (better read this):
Invite people in chat with alt-click.
Alt also shows the extra-actionbars on the right.
Keybinds are hidden, use the Dominos configuration to show/change them.
I focus with Ctrl+Q and target focus with Ctrl+E. Raidmarks are on the F-Keys.
Nearly all UI windows are bound to Shift+Key, the regular keys are bound to my naga.
	(Shift+M: Map, Shift+B: Bags, Shift+P: Spellbook,....)
Camera Zooming is bound to Ctrl+Mousewheel.
S is not bound to backpedal, but to stopcasting.


New versions will be pushed to GitHub first, so be sure to bookmark it, or check regularly.
You can also update the Addons by yourself, in case something breaks.

Oh, and by the way:
If you're either playing on EU-Stormscale, or planning on transfering there,
<Rapid Eye Movement> is looking for Players.
Contact me (Fineous), Graivs, Hayek or Crymlink if you're interested.
