IMPORTANT: TO DOWNLOAD FROM GITHUB YOU NEED TOO CLICK ON DOWNLOADS ON THE UPPER RIGHT SIDE!
(This might be hard to figure out if you don't know GitHub.)

THX for giving my UI a try. Feedback is welcome.

Instructions:
Step 1: Backup your "Interface" and "WTF" folders.
Step 2: Copy "Interface" and "WTF" to your WoW-Directory.
Step 3: Rename the Subfolders "ACCOUNTNAME", "SERVERNAME" and "CHARACTERNAME" to your
	considered values. (Have a look at your backup if you're not sure what your
	accountname is.)
	There is standard support for Warlocks (obviously) but it may work for most
	other classes, too.
Step 4: Organize your keybinds. I use nearly no visible actionbar, everything is bound and
	invisible (Commands below).
Step 5: Organize your CDs. I use Bartenders Bar 1 for cooldowns status. Disable "click-trough"
	in the options, drag your spells in and enable "click-through" again.
	The other bar on the right appears when pressing alt.
Step 6:	Login and have a look at the Interface. You might have to copy some addon-profiles
	from "Fineous", Server Stormscale.
	To help you, here is a short list of chat-commands:
	Unitframes: /suf
	Actionbars: /bt
	Keybinds: /bp
	Castbars: /quartz
	Chat: /prat
	Nameplates: /tidyplates
	Damage-/Healmeter: /skada config
	Bossmod: /dbm
	Map: /mapster
	Just look out for Profile-Options, choose Fineous-Stormscale and press copy.
	In case you want to reorganize something, you can toggle a grid by typing "/align".
Step 7: Profit!

(Optional) There is an Addon that changes the Damage Font (FontDamageChanger). If you want
to change the font, get a .ttf-file at dafont.com (or anywhere else), place it in
[WoW-Folder]\Interface\Addons\Fontdamagechanger\fontgoeshere and rename it to
FDCFONT.ttf. Should work with everyfont. If you're curious, I'm using Neuropol X.

New versions will be pushed to GitHub first, so be sure to bookmark it, or check regularly.
You can also update the Addons by yourself, in case something breaks.

Oh, and by the way:
If you're either playing on EU-Stormscale, or planning on transfering there,
<Rapid Eye Movement> is looking for Players.
Contact me (Fineous), Graivs or Crymlink if you're interested.
